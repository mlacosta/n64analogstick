# n64analogstick
This project is based on the instructable: https://www.instructables.com/id/Use-an-Arduino-with-an-N64-controller/ by quasse. Originally it uses Processing to read the data sent by the N64 controller in order control the keyboard and mouse. However, the mouse version doesn't work properly with an emulator because when the cursor reaches the border of the screen the movement of the character get stuck. That's because the script in Processing uses the java class Robot to move the cursor with the analog stick data which doesn't control the movement with deltas.
